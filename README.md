# Product Monitor
This project is missing key components, such as request headers and endpoints, and will not work out of the box.
Think of it as infrastructure for:
  1) Scraping products on the frontend using Selenium/Webdriver and BeautifulSoup
  2) Monitoring those products on the backend using Requests


Upgrade Ideas:
* Allowing targeting of specific items
* Add local database so items don't need to be loaded everytime program is started
* Add better handling of rate limits and functionality to get around them
